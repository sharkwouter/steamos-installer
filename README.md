# steamos-installer

 VaporOS - a modified version of the Stephenson's Rocket SteamOS installer, with a number of modifications.
 
# Improvements

- VaporOS supports BIOS and UEFI machines.
- VapoOS uses latest build version from steampowered beta repository if available and/or if different from steampowered main repository.
- VaporOS has a firewall installed by default, which can be easily configured from the desktop.
- VaporOS asks you to set a password for the desktop user when you open the desktop for the first time.
- VaporOS has trim support for Samsung and Intel SSD's.
- VaporOS offers a better out of the box desktop experience. Things like a text editor, media player, an archive manager and Gnome Tweak Tools are installed by default.
- VaporOS has an ssh server installed by default.
- VaporOS installs many tools to improve the command line experience. This includes bash completion, iotop, htop, mesa-utils, libav, pastebinit, screen, git and lsof. 
- VaporOS has XBMC installed by default.
- VaporOS has no mouse acceleration.
- VaporOS will not freeze on first boot for AMD graphics cards users, SteamOS still has this issue.

# Planned improvements

- Ideas welcome 

# How to install?

ISO's for the latest releases are always available on http://trashcan-gaming.nl/

Otherwise, clone this repo, and run `./gen.sh`. This will only work on Ubuntu. If you're a Debian Jessie user, you can make this work by install the packages [syslinux](http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/syslinux) and [syslinux-common](http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/syslinux-common) from Ubuntu.

## Installing from a DVD

Just burn the ISO to a blank DVD from your favourite tool, and boot it.

## Installing from USB (Mac)

Open a Terminal window from the Utilities section of Applications.

Type `diskutil list` to get a list of devices - one of them will be your USB stick (e.g. `/dev/disk2`). Follow the Linux instructions below, with this `/dev/rdiskX` entry instead of `/dev/sdX`

## Installing from USB (Linux)

Plug in the USB stick and run `dmesg`; look for a line similar to this:

    [377039.485179] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI removable disk

In this case, `sdc` is the device name for the USB stick you just inserted. Now we put the installer on the stick, as root (e.g. use `sudo`) run 

    dd bs=1M if=/path/to/vaporosX.iso of=/dev/sdX 
    
sdX should be the USB stick device from the information you received from `dmesg`. Be sure to use sdX, not sdX1 or sdX2. Then boot into the stick.

## Installing from USB (Windows)

Download [Win32 Disk Imager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) and use it to copy the .iso to your USB stick (1GB minimum size).

## Once the installer is up...

Pick the "Automatic Install" option to wipe the first hard disk in your system and install SteamOS to it.

For more sophisticated booting - e.g. dual-boot or custom partition sizes - select the "Expert" option. Use of this mode is documented in the support video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjkfMs-4T4).

Beyond that, just follow Valve's instructions from [their site](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown) - Stephenson's Rocket should behave exactly like the real SteamOS, except it works on more systems

# Known issues and workarounds

- Running in Virtualbox is not supported.
- On some systems with AMD gpu's you'll have underscan. This is not specific to VaporOS. A fix can be found [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/discussions/1/616187839533548192/#c626329186869925659).
- On some Nvidia systems, sound over hdmi doesn't work. This is not specific to VaporOS. A fix can be found [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/discussions/1/35221584678322281/#c35222218678959581).
